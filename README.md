# No Render Mod
##### My First Kotlin Mod ðŸŽ‰
This mod is a simple mod that disables the rendering of the game
```kotlin
how to use: 
write /no-render in the chat,then you will see 3 options:
add -> add entity to the no-render list
remove -> remove entity from the no-render list
list -> list all the entities that are not rendered
toggle -> toggle the mod on/off
```
Enjoy!
